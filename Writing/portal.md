## Public Policy
#### Evidence for a Gender Wage Gap in the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

In this report, I seek to determine whether there is a significant difference in income between men and women, and, if so, whether the difference observed varies depending on other factors (e.g., education, marital status, criminal history, drug use, childhood household factors, profession, etc.). To address this question, I use data collected from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY79).

#### Assessment of the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm

With the advance in machine learning techniques, an increasing number of jurisdictions across the United States are using risk assessment instruments (RAIs) to help judges make bail decisions. A major concern with the use of such models is that they might serve to exacerbate bias already present in the criminal justice system by exaggerating or otherwise distorting the meaning of patterns in the data used to train these statistical models. 

For the past several years, courts in Broward County, Florida have been using one of the RAIs in the COMPAS suite to inform pretrial release decisions by predicting the likelihood that a particular defendant will recidivate. In May 2016, investigative journalists from the independents, non-profit newsroom ProPublica conducted an analysis of one commercial RAI, the COMPAS tool by Northpointe (which stands for Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), and found that “black defendants were far more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher risk of recidivism, while white defendants were more likely than black defendants to be incorrectly flagged as low risk ([Propublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm).” In this report, I attempt to reproduce the ProPublica analysis in order to provide independent evidence either in support or in refutation of their findings.

#### Does Intellectual Propery Lead to Economic Growth?

The purported positive effect of strong intellectual property (IP) protections on economic growth in developing countries is a thesis so widely affirmed among economists studying this relationship that it has almost become an article of faith. And yet the results of empirical research into this relationship are much more ambiguous. Determining the true relationship between the strength of a country’s IP protections and its economic growth, as well as the mechanism by which that relationship occurs, is of critical importance to policy makers looking to wield this instrument constructively.

#### An Assessment of Community-Based Models for the Conservation of Biodiversity

Since the United States first established a National Park System in 1872, the predominant model for land preservation has been largely militaristic in nature, relying on guard patrols and stiff penalties in order to deter human activity within park boundaries (Chapin 2004). Such an approach, however, has had a significant impact on many indigenous people groups who call these lands home. Many in the conservationist community believe that the preservationist approach to park management are unable to balance the competing objectives of conservationists and indigenous peoples (Wells et al. 1992). During the late 1980s and early 1990s, therefore, a variety of alternative strategies to biodiversity conservation were considered which attempted to build on the premise that “successful conservation means contented neighbors” (Honey 2008, p. 193). This paper considers the relative strengths and weaknesses of two of the most common community-based strategies: integrated conservation-development projects (ICDPs) and ecotourism.

#### Sustainable Campus Project Final Report

A joint study conducted in the Fall semester of 2017 by students from the Department of Engineering and Public Policy (EPP) and the Department of Social and Decision Sciences (SDS) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) sought to analyze options for a commitment by CMU to reduce its GHG emissions as if it were a party to the Paris Agreement. The main findings of this report were subsequently used by the Ad Hoc Committee on Sustainability, formed by the Senate Executive Committee in May 2018, “to provide advice to the Faculty Senate on the need for further university action related to sustainability at the university.” 

This project seeks to determine the extent to which equipping CMU students and other key stakeholders with accurate, up-to-date GHG emissions data for all CMU buildings and installations, along with a to be determined suite of analytical tools for rapid translation of data into actionable insights, might facilitate collective action in support of implementing the Sustainability Committee’s recommendations. If successful, the model could be reproduced in other settings in which the levers of power still lie in the hands of a privileged few and perhaps encourage greater accountability of officials to the will of their constituents.
