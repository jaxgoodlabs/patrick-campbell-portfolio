## About me 
<img align="left" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32546509/77238966-de37cd00-6bab-11ea-9b9b-e49783f8300a.jpg">
My name is Patrick Campbell and I’m a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University's Public Policy and Management master's program (MSPPM). Prior to enrolling at Carnegie Mellon, I worked for over eight years in a wide variety of positions in the areas of environmental science and conservation. My early career was devoted primarily to addressing water quality issues in South Florida, where I worked as an environmental consultant in support of several projects managed by the South Florida Water Management District. During this time, I gained a lot of valuable experience both in water quality and other field sampling techniques as well as in the broader policy environment surrounding the local management of natural resources.<br />
<br />
I first became interested in the social applications of data science through my engagement with the Effective Altruism and Data Science for Social Good communities, which seek to apply reason and evidence to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. My interactions with these communities opened my eyes to the depth of need that exists within the public sector both for more high-quality data as well as for the knowledge and skills to put that data to effective use.<br />
<br />
This realization is what ultimately led me to Carnegie Mellon, and to Heinz College in particular. As the country’s top-rated program in analytics education with a mission of training students to “turn raw data into solutions for society’s most pressing problems,” the MSPPM program at Carnegie Mellon offered the perfect opportunity to develop the technical competencies I was seeking as well as an ideal environment to practice those skills in a real-world setting—namely, the City of Pittsburgh and its diverse network of organizational partners.<br />
<br />
My most recent projects have focused on public interest technologies that help to increase the range and accessibility of social services worldwide, especially as a means of increasing society's resilience to global threats like climate change.
