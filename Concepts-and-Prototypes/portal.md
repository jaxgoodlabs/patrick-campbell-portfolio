rosettaHUB Work Party is an application that provides a low-barrier-to-entry solution to the problem that distributed peer-to-peer work groups face in transitioning team members from minimal initial knowledge to a state of high productivity. In so doing, it aims to enable [deep group work sessions](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM), or [collective flow states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), which are the hallmark (or more often, the vanishing ideal) of well-functioning CBPP ecosystems.
